## Initial Project Thoughts

The initial project aim is to extend the current Open Scout. Extend means improve in any way deemed fit but with the idea of integrating ROS.

## Initial OpenScout Evaluation

Time was taken to appreciate and understand the previous iteration of the project which was undertaken my the previous MSc RAS cohort 3.
